# Startup Crunch

## Built with:
* Ruby on Rails v.5.2.0
* ActiveRecord
* PostgreSQL
* User Authentication via Devise gem
* Deploying to Heroku
* Bootstrap


### Goal:

To collaborate, organize and create an MVP web product using Ruby on Rails for a potential investor within a group setting.
 

### Learning Objectives:  

Upon successful completion of this project, the student will demonstrate an understanding of HTML, CSS, JS, Ruby on Rails, Team Dynamics and Workplace Simulation.


### Introduction

Until now you have worked on different web applications that have their constraints mostly dictated to you in concrete terms. Our goal was to familiarize you with the fundamentals of software development in such a way that you can see the diversity in the field. Now that you have had months of practice, we present you with a more open ended challenge that more closely resembles a real world startup scenario.

You are an up and coming startup team and you are working on a unique idea to pitch to a potential investor so you can receive your first round of funding. However, in order to convince your investor to risk their monies on you, you have to provide them with the following:

* a pitch describing what the product does and what problem itâ€™s trying to solve
* wireframes of your webapp
* schema diagrams of your database structure
* a plan for the division of labor among your team
* an MVP of your product
* a presentation that incorporates your initial pitch as well as a high level walkthrough in 7 days.


### First Steps Checklist

1. Decide as a team what your product is going to do, what problem it is trying to solve and what inspired the idea.
2. Use this to draw up a wireframe layout of every page on the website. This will serve as your starting point.
3. Once you are done with the wireframes, fill out the proposal form and submit it to your investor (instructor).
4. Your instructor will set time to meet with you to determine product approval.
5. Once approved, begin working on determining product features and division of labor.
F6. inalize your deadlines, github issues and overall roadmap before writing any code on your computer.

**Begin coding your product only after being approved first.**


### What is a Product?

Before this point, you have created projects that reinforce the topics taught throughout the course. From this point forward you will be tasked with creating products. Generally speaking, in this context, a product differs from a project in that it should be usable without any input from the product creator(s).

More specifically, a product should:

* accomplish a goal or solve a problem
* have every page be reachable by using the application
* clearly indicate to the user what it does
* notify the user when an error occurs, in a meaningful way


### Product Features

*Team Leaders*

To begin, choose a team lead for your group. The team lead is responsible for merging pull requests, product consistency, division of labor, the product roadmap and will be representing your team during morning checkins. This person must also contribute features to the overall product as well but in a more limited capacity than other team members. Other team members are responsible for the majority of features and must check in with the team lead to determine if the application is on pace for completion.

*Proposal*

For this product, you are required to fill out proposal form before speaking with your instructor. This form identifies all the major points that your instructor needs in order to make a decision on if your product feasibility. Along with this proposal form, you also need to provide wireframes of your webapp and schema diagrams of your database. This will help you identify the details of what your application does so you can focus on creating the product from that point forward.

**This proposal form is due on the second day of startup product week.**

*Standups*

Your instructor will facilitate daily standups (limited to a max of 15 minutes) with the team lead to discuss progress, roadblocks, changes to scope and target deliverables. Be prepared to demo your application for feedback. If you have any questions, please prepare them beforehand as well.

On your last standup your instructor will evaluate your team collaboration and suggest improvements for the future. These conversations should give you an indication of where your collaboration grade stands.

*Presentation*

All products must be presented to your instructor and fellow classmates. Presentation instructions are listed here (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site..


### Grading

You will be graded on the following:

* **User Experience - 10%**
  * Is the application simple to use?
  * Does it make sense to the target audience?
  * Can a new user just pick up and use it?

*  **Overall Design - 10%**
  * User interface consistency
  * Font Usage
  * Colors Usage
  * Element alignment

* **Code Cleanliness - 10%**
  * Code indentation
  * Commenting
  * Function/Variable naming
  * Best practices

* **Collaboration - 15%**
  * Pull requests
  * Division of labor
  * Merge conflicts
  * Teamwork
  * Personal conflict resolution
  * Github Issues
  * Product Completeness - 50%
  * Is it functional?
  * Does it accomplish its goal?
 
* **Killer (Unique) Features - 5%**
  * What feature is unique to your application?
  * What stands out in your application?


### Final Words
 
This startup product is your last opportunity to apply what you've learned about software development in this class to a product you can show your peers, instructors, and potential employers in a team setting. The product itself will be a full-featured Rails web application. You're welcome to incorporate any additional frameworks or libraries that you think may improve the overall quality of the product.

Best of luck with your product and as always questions are encouraged!
